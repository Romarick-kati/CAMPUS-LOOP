# minizlibA fast zlib stream built on [minipass](http://npm.im/minipass) andNode.js's zlib binding.This module was created to serve the needs of[node-tar](http://npm.im/tar) and[minipass-fetch](http://npm.im/minipass-fetch).Brotli is supported in versions of node with a Brotli binding.## How does this differ from the streams in `require('zlib')`?First, there are no convenience methods to compress or decompress abuffer.  If you want those, use the built-in `zlib` module.  This isonly streams.  That being said, Minipass streams to make it fairly easy touse as one-liners: `new zlib.Deflate().end(data).read()` will return thedeflate compressed result.This module compresses and decompresses the data as fast as you feedit in.  It is synchronous, and runs on the main process thread.  Zliband Brotli operations can be high CPU, but they're very fast, and doing itthis way means much less bookkeeping and artificial deferral.Node's built in zlib streams are built on top of `stream.Transform`.They do the maximally safe thing with respect to consistentasynchrony, buffering, and backpressure.See [Minipass](http://npm.im/minipass) for more on the differences betweenNode.js core streams and Minipass streams, and the convenience methodsprovided by that class.## Classes- Deflate- Inflate- Gzip- Gunzip- DeflateRaw- InflateRaw- Unzip- BrotliCompress (Node v10 and higher)- BrotliDecompress (Node v10 and higher)## USAGE```jsconst zlib = require('minizlib')const input = sourceOfCompressedData()const decode = new zlib.BrotliDecompress()const output = whereToWriteTheDecodedData()input.pipe(decode).pipe(output)```## REPRODUCIBLE BUILDSTo create reproducible gzip compressed files across different operatingsystems, set `portable: true` in the options.  This causes minizlib to setthe `OS` indicator in byte 9 of the extended gzip header to `0xFF` for'unknown'.
