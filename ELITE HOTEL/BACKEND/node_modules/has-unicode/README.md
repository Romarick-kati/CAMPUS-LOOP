has-unicode===========Try to guess if your terminal supports unicode```javascriptvar hasUnicode = require("has-unicode")if (hasUnicode()) {  // the terminal probably has unicode support}``````javascriptvar hasUnicode = require("has-unicode").tryHarderhasUnicode(function(unicodeSupported) {  if (unicodeSupported) {    // the terminal probably has unicode support  }})```## Detecting UnicodeWhat we actually detect is UTF-8 support, as that's what Node itself supports.If you have a UTF-16 locale then you won't be detected as unicode capable.### WindowsSince at least Windows 7, `cmd` and `powershell` have been unicode capable,but unfortunately even then it's not guaranteed. In many localizations itstill uses legacy code pages and there's no facility short of runningprograms or linking C++ that will let us detect this. As such, wereport any Windows installation as NOT unicode capable, and recommendthat you encourage your users to override this via config.### Unix Like Operating SystemsWe look at the environment variables `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, and `LANG` inthat order.  For `LC_ALL` and `LANG`, it looks for `.UTF-8` in the value. For `LC_CTYPE` it looks to see if the value is `UTF-8`.  This is sufficientfor most POSIX systems.  While locale data can be put in `/etc/locale.conf`as well, AFAIK it's always copied into the environment.
