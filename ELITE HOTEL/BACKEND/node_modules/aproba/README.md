aproba======A ridiculously light-weight function argument validator```var validate = require("aproba")function myfunc(a, b, c) {  // `a` must be a string, `b` a number, `c` a function  validate('SNF', arguments) // [a,b,c] is also valid}myfunc('test', 23, function () {}) // okmyfunc(123, 23, function () {}) // type errormyfunc('test', 23) // missing arg errormyfunc('test', 23, function () {}, true) // too many args error```Valid types are:| type | description| :--: | :----------| *    | matches any type| A    | `Array.isArray` OR an `arguments` object| S    | typeof == string| N    | typeof == number| F    | typeof == function| O    | typeof == object and not type A and not type E| B    | typeof == boolean| E    | `instanceof Error` OR `null` **(special: see below)**| Z    | == `null`Validation failures throw one of three exception types, distinguished by a`code` property of `EMISSINGARG`, `EINVALIDTYPE` or `ETOOMANYARGS`.If you pass in an invalid type then it will throw with a code of`EUNKNOWNTYPE`.If an **error** argument is found and is not null then the remainingarguments are optional.  That is, if you say `ESO` then that's like using anon-magical `E` in: `E|ESO|ZSO`.### But I have optional arguments?!You can provide more than one signature by separating them with pipes `|`.If any signature matches the arguments then they'll be considered valid.So for example, say you wanted to write a signature for`fs.createWriteStream`.  The docs for it describe it thusly:```fs.createWriteStream(path[, options])```This would be a signature of `SO|S`.  That is, a string and and object, orjust a string.Now, if you read the full `fs` docs, you'll see that actually path can ALSObe a buffer.  And options can be a string, that is:```path <String> | <Buffer>options <String> | <Object>```To reproduce this you have to fully enumerate all of the possiblecombinations and that implies a signature of `SO|SS|OO|OS|S|O`.  Theawkwardness is a feature: It reminds you of the complexity you're adding toyour API when you do this sort of thing.### Browser supportThis has no dependencies and should work in browsers, though you'll havenoisier stack traces.### Why this existsI wanted a very simple argument validator. It needed to do two things:1. Be more concise and easier to use than assertions2. Not encourage an infinite bikeshed of DSLsThis is why types are specified by a single character and there's no suchthing as an optional argument. This is not intended to validate user data. This is specifically aboutasserting the interface of your functions.If you need greater validation, I encourage you to write them by hand orlook elsewhere.
