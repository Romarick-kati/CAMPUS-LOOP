wide-align----------A wide-character aware text alignment function for use in terminals / on theconsole.### Usage```var align = require('wide-align')// Note that if you view this on a unicode console, all of the slashes are// aligned. This is because on a console, all narrow characters are// an en wide and all wide characters are an em. In browsers, this isn't// held to and wide characters like "???" can be less than two narrow// characters even with a fixed width font.console.log(align.center('abc', 10))     // '   abc    'console.log(align.center('?????????', 10))  // '  ?????????  'console.log(align.left('abc', 10))       // 'abc       'console.log(align.left('?????????', 10))    // '?????????    'console.log(align.right('abc', 10))      // '       abc'console.log(align.right('?????????', 10))   // '    ?????????'```### Functions#### `align.center(str, length)` ??? `str`Returns *str* with spaces added to both sides such that that it is *length*chars long and centered in the spaces.#### `align.left(str, length)` ??? `str`Returns *str* with spaces to the right such that it is *length* chars long.### `align.right(str, length)` ??? `str`Returns *str* with spaces to the left such that it is *length* chars long.### OriginsThese functions were originally taken from [cliui](https://npmjs.com/package/cliui).
