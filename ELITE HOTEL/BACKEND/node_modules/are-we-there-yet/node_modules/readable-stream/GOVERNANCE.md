### Streams Working GroupThe Node.js Streams is jointly governed by a Working Group(WG)that is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.The WG has final authority over this project including:* Technical direction* Project governance and process (including this policy)* Contribution policy* GitHub repository hosting* Conduct guidelines* Maintaining the list of additional CollaboratorsFor the current list of WG members, see the project[README.md](./README.md#current-project-team-members).### CollaboratorsThe readable-stream GitHub repository ismaintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are added by theWG on an ongoing basis.Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are madeCollaborators and given commit-access to the project. Theseindividuals are identified by the WG and their addition asCollaborators is discussed during the WG meeting._Note:_ If you make a significant contribution and are not consideredfor commit-access log an issue or contact a WG member directly and itwill be brought up in the next WG meeting.Modifications of the contents of the readable-stream repository aremade ona collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose amodification via pull request and it will be considered by the projectCollaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by aCollaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take fullresponsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposedby an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is requiredfor sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaboratorsparticipate and there is disagreement around a particularmodification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detailon the consensus model used for governance.Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversialmodifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to theWG for discussion by assigning the ***WG-agenda*** tag to a pullrequest or issue. The WG should serve as the final arbiter whererequired.For the current list of Collaborators, see the project[README.md](./README.md#members).### WG MembershipWG seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the WG.However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequatecoverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability tomake decisions efficiently.There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WGmembership beyond these rules.The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or byunanimous consensus of all other WG members.Changes to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may besuggested as any other agenda item (see "WG Meetings" below).If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the fullWG is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removalis added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting.  This is to ensurethat all members are given the opportunity to participate in allmembership decisions.  If a WG member is unable to attend a meetingwhere a planned membership decision is being made, then their consentis assumed.No more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the sameemployer.  If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change ofemployment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 ofthe WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must beimmediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WGmembers affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).### WG MeetingsThe WG meets occasionally on a Google Hangout On Air. A designated moderatorapproved by the WG runs the meeting. Each meeting should bepublished to YouTube.Items are added to the WG agenda that are considered contentious orare modifications of governance, contribution policy, WG membership,or release process.The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the largergroup of Collaborators.Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added tothe next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,WG member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by addingthe ***WG-agenda*** tag to the issue.Prior to each WG meeting the moderator will share the Agenda withmembers of the WG. WG members can add any items they like to theagenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the WGcannot veto or remove items.The WG may invite persons or representatives from certain projects toparticipate in a non-voting capacity.The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of eachagenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.### Consensus Seeking ProcessThe WG follows a[ConsensusSeeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)decision-making model.When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderatorwill ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from theconsensus.If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call foreither a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the nextmeeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WGor else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.Note that changes to WG membership require a majority consensus.
