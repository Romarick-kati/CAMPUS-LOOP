# fs.realpathA backwards-compatible fs.realpath for Node v6 and aboveIn Node v6, the JavaScript implementation of fs.realpath was replacedwith a faster (but less resilient) native implementation.  That raisesnew and platform-specific errors and cannot handle long or excessivelysymlink-looping paths.This module handles those cases by detecting the new errors andfalling back to the JavaScript implementation.  On versions of Nodeprior to v6, it has no effect.## USAGE```jsvar rp = require('fs.realpath')// async versionrp.realpath(someLongAndLoopingPath, function (er, real) {  // the ELOOP was handled, but it was a bit slower})// sync versionvar real = rp.realpathSync(someLongAndLoopingPath)// monkeypatch at your own risk!// This replaces the fs.realpath/fs.realpathSync builtinsrp.monkeypatch()// un-do the monkeypatchingrp.unmonkeypatch()```
