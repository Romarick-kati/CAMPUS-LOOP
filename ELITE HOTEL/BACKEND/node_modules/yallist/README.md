# yallistYet Another Linked ListThere are many doubly-linked list implementations like it, but thisone is mine.For when an array would be too big, and a Map can't be iterated inreverse order.[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/yallist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/yallist) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/isaacs/yallist/badge.svg?service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/isaacs/yallist)## basic usage```javascriptvar yallist = require('yallist')var myList = yallist.create([1, 2, 3])myList.push('foo')myList.unshift('bar')// of course pop() and shift() are there, tooconsole.log(myList.toArray()) // ['bar', 1, 2, 3, 'foo']myList.forEach(function (k) {  // walk the list head to tail})myList.forEachReverse(function (k, index, list) {  // walk the list tail to head})var myDoubledList = myList.map(function (k) {  return k + k})// now myDoubledList contains ['barbar', 2, 4, 6, 'foofoo']// mapReverse is also a thingvar myDoubledListReverse = myList.mapReverse(function (k) {  return k + k}) // ['foofoo', 6, 4, 2, 'barbar']var reduced = myList.reduce(function (set, entry) {  set += entry  return set}, 'start')console.log(reduced) // 'startfoo123bar'```## apiThe whole API is considered "public".Functions with the same name as an Array method work more or less thesame way.There's reverse versions of most things because that's the point.### YallistDefault export, the class that holds and manages a list.Call it with either a forEach-able (like an array) or a set ofarguments, to initialize the list.The Array-ish methods all act like you'd expect.  No magic length,though, so if you change that it won't automatically prune or addempty spots.### Yallist.create(..)Alias for Yallist function.  Some people like factories.#### yallist.headThe first node in the list#### yallist.tailThe last node in the list#### yallist.lengthThe number of nodes in the list.  (Change this at your peril.  It isnot magic like Array length.)#### yallist.toArray()Convert the list to an array.#### yallist.forEach(fn, [thisp])Call a function on each item in the list.#### yallist.forEachReverse(fn, [thisp])Call a function on each item in the list, in reverse order.#### yallist.get(n)Get the data at position `n` in the list.  If you use this a lot,probably better off just using an Array.#### yallist.getReverse(n)Get the data at position `n`, counting from the tail.#### yallist.map(fn, thisp)Create a new Yallist with the result of calling the function on eachitem.#### yallist.mapReverse(fn, thisp)Same as `map`, but in reverse.#### yallist.pop()Get the data from the list tail, and remove the tail from the list.#### yallist.push(item, ...)Insert one or more items to the tail of the list.#### yallist.reduce(fn, initialValue)Like Array.reduce.#### yallist.reduceReverseLike Array.reduce, but in reverse.#### yallist.reverseReverse the list in place.#### yallist.shift()Get the data from the list head, and remove the head from the list.#### yallist.slice([from], [to])Just like Array.slice, but returns a new Yallist.#### yallist.sliceReverse([from], [to])Just like yallist.slice, but the result is returned in reverse.#### yallist.toArray()Create an array representation of the list.#### yallist.toArrayReverse()Create a reversed array representation of the list.#### yallist.unshift(item, ...)Insert one or more items to the head of the list.#### yallist.unshiftNode(node)Move a Node object to the front of the list.  (That is, pull it out ofwherever it lives, and make it the new head.)If the node belongs to a different list, then that list will remove itfirst.#### yallist.pushNode(node)Move a Node object to the end of the list.  (That is, pull it out ofwherever it lives, and make it the new tail.)If the node belongs to a list already, then that list will remove itfirst.#### yallist.removeNode(node)Remove a node from the list, preserving referential integrity of headand tail and other nodes.Will throw an error if you try to have a list remove a node thatdoesn't belong to it.### Yallist.NodeThe class that holds the data and is actually the list.Call with `var n = new Node(value, previousNode, nextNode)`Note that if you do direct operations on Nodes themselves, it's veryeasy to get into weird states where the list is broken.  Be careful :)#### node.nextThe next node in the list.#### node.prevThe previous node in the list.#### node.valueThe data the node contains.#### node.listThe list to which this node belongs.  (Null if it does not belong toany list.)
